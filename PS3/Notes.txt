Possible Bot Characteristics:
---------------------------
To learn from experience:
	- Go till the end on the first round if possible to find their end condition - for first round hold 
		out to the end, be the most stubborn, maybe they will learn to accommodate me
	- Figuring out what their lower bound is 
	- in how many turns they will accept
---------------------------
General Rules
	- Never make concessions if they don’t - if go first restate offer on second turn - if second they 
		will be the one to make next offer
	- Adjust acceptance threshold based on past - if got 80% last time then demand 85% - never go bellow 50%
---------------------------
To put forth list:
	○ Run the utility function against every possible ordering of list and store it
	○ Order list in greatest utility to least
	○ Put forth offers in that order
	---------------------------
	○ Have function to randomly generate offers, run utility
	○ Put forth list if at a certain percentage - if exceed iteration threshold lower the percentage
----------------------------
Acceptance
	- If offer is within 95%  take it
	- If offer worse than 50% of max never take it
	- Don't change rules even if last offer
-------------------------------------------------
Bot1
	- put forth ideal list first, assume they do the same
	- if rejected: determine what their utility is on our ideal, set this as minimum utility for them
	- Use random list generator - generate between certain percentages
		- start at 100-95, try to find list organization in that range that has a higher utility than
			their min
		- have to put cap on iteration, then move on to next bracket down (95-90)
---------------------
	• Random first offer to break other bot
	• Don't want to let the other negotiator know what I really want - maybe steal strategy from poker
